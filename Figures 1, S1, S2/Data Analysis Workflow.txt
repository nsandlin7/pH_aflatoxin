Raw data files contain the readings for a 96-well plate with various conditions/replicates that can be found in the Plate Layout excel file.

General analysis of the data:
	1. Run the raw data file through ReadRawData.m
	2. Load and run the resulting file through ConversionofRFUtoToxin.m
	3. Load and run the resulting file through CalculateToxinRemovalRates.m

Resulting information:
	2. Toxin concentrations for each timepoint based on a calibration curve
	3. Degradation efficiency and degradation curves
